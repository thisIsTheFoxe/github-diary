# GitHub Diary
> Humans are excellent record keepers and archivists.

I can't remember where I heard that, but it is most certainly true. We have sent many probes out into space and keep broadcasting signals all throughout the universe. Even here on earth there are tens of thousands of time capsules (like GitHubs Arcitc Code Vault) preserving information about us and the ones who came before. 
Nowadays, most data is kept digitally. From every post we make to every tweet we write and – especially for us developers – also our git commit messages. 

This fun, little project lets you re-trace your or anyone else's past commits...


*Disclaimer: This project only lists commits for public GitHub repositories. If you find an unwanted commit message in your repo you can [change it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/changing-a-commit-message).*
